# VisualStudioMac.OneClickToOpenFile
Visual studio Mac 2022 extension to open a file with one click

As a developer I got annoyed at VSMac for all of that double clicking a file on the solution tree to view it. Thus this feature. It will reduce your mouse clicking drastically during the day. Please do learn your CMD + SHIFT + W shortcut to close all open windows.
